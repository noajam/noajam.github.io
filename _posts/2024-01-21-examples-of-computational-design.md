Computational design can be pretty much anything that's aided by computer instructions. However, when we say "computational design," we generally refer to some sort of pattern or algorithm that produces a visual. A great example for this is fractals. Fractals can be generated completely via mathematics and algorithms, creating pleasing visual designs in the process. When looking for examples of computational design, we begin by looking for patterns, because these imply a regularity that can be replicated with computer instructions. In this post, I will go through several examples of computational design in both nature and human creations.

# Computational Design in Nature
## Botanical World: Pinecones
Pinecones are an example of a consistent pattern that can be found in nature. They are formed by conifers, trees that prroduce cone structures surrounding the seeds. The common pinecone is an example of this with an overall ellipsoid or egg shape that eventually spreads open upon maturation during the warmer seasons. The opened form of the pinecone allows the protected seeds to be released and germinate.

The intricate, often diamond-shaped protrusion pattern of pinecones is what makes it appear computational in design. While the pinecone grows on a branch, it gradually increases in size while producing the interlocking pattern of scales that protects seeds inside. It's quite fascinating that this brilliant structural function was able to evolve in nature.

## Zoological World: Peacocks
While most birds have interesting feather patterns that can illustrate computational-esque design in nature, none are as flashy as the peacock. The peackock's tail pattern features metallic green feathers that are tipped with an vibrant eyespot. During courtship displays or for intimidating predators, the peacock will fan out its feathers as shown in the below image. The repeated pattern of feathers and eyespots appears is very reminiscent of computational design. Additionally, if you look closely, you can see a multitude of short, layered, yellow-green feathers just on the peacock's back. These newer feathers show a shift from small to large as you go from the body to the outside of its tail.

## Environment Built by Organisms: Crown Shyness
Crown shyness is a phenomenon wherein some species of trees have canopies naturally shy away from each other, leaving gaps when looking from below. This is believed to be caused by abrasion of the tree limbs during storms and windy weather, resulting in the characterisic gaps, but there is also evidence that for some species crown shyness can emerge the same regardless of weather patterns. One hypothesis is that sunlight plays a factor, but scientists have proposed other possibilities such as symbiosis with other plant species on the forest floor.

# Computational Design in Human Environments

## Architecture: Roppongi National Museum of Modern Art

While I was studying abroad in Japan, I had the pleasure to visit the Roppongi district in Tokyo. The district was sort of a modern art hub within the city, and it featured many interesting architectural designs, many of which appeared to have been done computationally. The video from the <a href="https://www.nact.jp/english/introduce/about.html">Tokyo National Art Center</a> below shows one such case, with the building itself appearing to be a parameteric surface comprised of glass. Other geometries such as cones and circles are built into the structure, no doubt designed and fabricated completely with the help of mathematical computations.

Below you can see some of the pictures I took of the building.

## Textiles: Glitch Textiles by Phillip David Stearns

<a href="https://glitchtextiles.com/home">Glitch Textiles</a> is a company that was founded in 2012 by designer Stearns with the mission to fabricate textiles with the appearance of computer glitches. Various methods were used for the designs, but originally, circuit bent digital cameras were used to generate the glitch effect. The blankets were then woven with the design on computerized Jacquard looms.

## Engineering: Airplanes, Jets, and Rockets

With this example, I'm definitely being more general, but I did find a "spaceship" to show for reference. Although initial conceptions of airplanes in the 20th century were designed through a mix of theory and empirical studies, modern aerospace engineering has definitely reached a point where extensive computation can be valuable. Modern aircraft designs are likely passed through fluid dynamic simulations to determine optimal structures for increasing lift and thrust. Spaceflight is even a step above, and some rather eccentric designs such as the SpaceShip III from Virgin Galactic have emerged as a result, and I believe that these were vetted against a large number of computer simulations beforehand, resulting in the computational design you see now.
