Computational design can be pretty much anything that's aided by computer instructions. However, when we say "computational design," we generally refer to some sort of pattern or algorithm that produces a visual. A great example for this is fractals. Fractals can be generated completely via mathematics and algorithms, creating pleasing visual designs in the process. When looking for examples of computational design, we begin by looking for patterns, because these imply a regularity that can be replicated with computer instructions.

# Computational Design in Nature
## Botanical World: Pinecones
Pinecones are an example of a consistent pattern that can be found in nature. They are formed by conifers, trees that prroduce cone structures surrounding the seeds. The common pinecone is an example of this with an overall ellipsoid or egg shape that eventually spreads open upon maturation during the warmer seasons. The opened form of the pinecone allows the protected seeds to be released and germinate.

The intricate, often diamond-shaped protrusion pattern of pinecones is what makes it appear computational in design. While the pinecone grows on a branch, it gradually increases in size while producing the interlocking pattern of scales that protects seeds inside. It's quite fascinating that this brilliant structural function was able to evolve in nature.

## Zoological World: Peacocks
While most birds have interesting feather patterns that can illustrate computational-esque design in nature, none are as flashy as the peacock. The peackock's tail pattern features metallic green feathers that are tipped with an vibrant eyespot. During courtship displays or for intimidating predators, the peacock will fan out its feathers as shown in the below image. The repeated pattern of feathers and eyespots appears is very reminiscent of computational design. Additionally, if you look closely, you can see a multitude of short, layered, yellow-green feathers just on the peacock's back. These newer feathers show a shift from small to large as you go from the body to the outside of its tail.
