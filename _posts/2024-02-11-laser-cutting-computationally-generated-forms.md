For this assignment in my Computational Fabrication course, I created a few designs using <a href="https://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu/glad-you-asked/cones">Processing</a>, a simple IDE and library for learning to code that is quite useful for quickly drawing up some computational designs using the built-in functions. For 2 of my designs, I simply started with some simple shapes and parameters to edit them before passing them through loops to generate geometric forms with interesting variation. The third design I manually put together with inspiration from album art by one of my favorite artists. I then worked in Rhino to prepare 2 of the designs for engraving and cutting in a laser cutter. Special thanks to Quinn Pearson from the BTU Lab at CU Boulder for helping me set up and walk me through the process of working with the laser cutters in the BTU Lab.

# Materials

For materials, I ended up using some 0.2 inch thick pine wood sheets that I found at Michaels. This was a good thickness for the laser cutter and allowed some deeper engravings in the designs. The sheets' dimensions were 5.2 x 12 inches. For the assignment, the 2 selected designs needed to be cut or engraved in at least 5 x 5 inches of material.

# Computational Designs and Results
## Cross-Section Sphere

To preface my choice of designs, I will say that I enjoy the aesthetics of wireframes. This preference of mine is likely due to being able to see through the objects and thus see more of their overall form.

## Fish-eye Wireframe Cubes


## Crescent Moon
The framing of this design is based on the artwork by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DeadCrownDesign">Alex Pryle</a> for the album cover of Sweet Nothings by Plini. Since I liked this piece so much, I initially attempted to recreate each element with mathematical functions and basic shapes, but I was quickly overwhelmed with the minute details of the rocket ship. I kept the crescent moon and black hole in the center and added sinewy connections to the border of the design to produce a dissonance between the astronomical centerpiece and biological backdrop.
